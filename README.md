# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling for invalid input parameters.  Specifically, the `/users/:id` route attempts to parse the `id` parameter as an integer without validation, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or crashes if the parameter is not a valid number.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

## Bug

The main issue lies in the absence of input validation.  The code directly attempts to parse `req.params.id` as an integer using `parseInt()` without verifying that it represents a valid numerical value. This can lead to errors if the ID is not numeric, causing `parseInt()` to return `NaN` and leading to unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The solution involves adding input validation to ensure the `userId` is a valid number before attempting to use it. This can involve using `isNaN()` to check if the parsed value is a number and handling invalid IDs gracefully, such as by returning a 400 Bad Request status code.
